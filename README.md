# Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model to determine the likelihood of successful landings of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket's first stage. The ability to reuse the first stage of rockets is a significant cost-saving measure, as it reduces the need for new materials and construction for each launch. With the cost of a new Falcon 9 launch advertised at approximately 62 million dollars—significantly lower than other providers, which can cost over 165 million dollars—predicting successful landings can greatly affect the financial dynamics of space launches.

## Motivation
SpaceX has revolutionized the economics of space travel with its reusable rocket technology. By accurately predicting the outcomes of first stage landings, we can better estimate the costs associated with each launch. This model could also serve competitors or new entrants in the space launch market, providing them with crucial data to formulate competitive bids against traditional single-use launch providers.

## Data Sources
The data for this project will include:
- Historical launch records and outcomes from SpaceX.
- Technical parameters of rocket launches (payload weight, launch angle, etc.).
- Environmental conditions at the time of each launch.

## Methodology
- **Data Collection**: Aggregate data from various public and proprietary sources concerning Falcon 9 launches.
- **Data Processing**: Clean and preprocess the data to suit the needs of predictive modeling.
- **Model Building**: Use machine learning algorithms to predict the probability of successful landings.
- **Evaluation**: Assess the model using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).

## Tools and Technologies
- Python for data processing and machine learning.
- Libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-learn for modeling, and Matplotlib for visualization.
